            As the name suggests, copy trading allows you to directly replicate the positions taken by another trader.
            You
            determine how much you want to invest and automatically copy their trades in real-time. When that trader
            makes
            a trade, your account executes the same trade as well. You don't need to intervene in the trading process,
            and
            you receive identical returns to those of the chosen trader. By copying successful traders, you have the
            potential to profit from their expertise, all without requiring advanced knowledge of the financial market.

            Copy trading serves as both a product and a service for traders and investors looking to capitalize on
            cryptocurrency trading. The ability to copy trades from multiple expert traders provides a valuable service,
            allowing investors to benefit from their strategies.

            We have been trading in various markets for many years and have recently ventured into cryptocurrency
            trading
            with considerable success. Initially, we aimed to create a single portfolio of coins and manage everyone’s
            funds in one account. However, we quickly recognized that keeping funds segregated and allowing investors
            control over their assets was essential, especially for attracting outside investors. After exploring the
            market, we found that there was no existing mechanism for copying trades in this space, which led us to
            develop this project.

            The concept of copy trading originated in 2005 when traders began employing specific algorithms developed
            for
            automated trading. Brokers recognized the potential of systems that allowed linked traders to automatically
            replicate each other’s trading accounts, eliminating the need for constant monitoring of email signals or
            trading chat rooms. This innovation led to services enabling traders to connect their personal accounts to a
            platform without having to disclose their specific strategies. Since then, the popularity of copy trading
            has
            skyrocketed, with 1 in 3 people finding a traditional stock market approach overly complex, suggesting that
            the process can be simplified by automatically following successful traders. Last year, 1 in 4 investors
            expressed interest in copy trading.

            Here’s how copying works: As an investor, you simply choose one or more experts whose trades you want to
            replicate. Once you’re signed up, that’s all you need to do.
            After completing the steps above, you are ready to go. There are no codes to input or signals to manually
            follow. Our software will automatically handle the trade copying for you. We monitor your chosen expert's
            trading activity, and as soon as a trade occurs, we calculate the necessary parameters and execute the trade
            in your account.
            The only requirement is that you have sufficient funds available in your trading account. When the expert
            exits a position, you will exit it as well—automatically.

          <p class="text-caption text-sm-body-2">
            We carefully select expert applicants, getting to know them as traders and analyzing their performance over
            time. We also look for experts with an existing following, providing additional social proof of their
            competence. You can read about each expert’s performance on their individual pages.

          <p class="text-caption text-sm-body-2" style="text-transform: uppercase">HOW DOES THIS WORK</p>
          <p class="text-caption text-sm-body-2">
            Here’s how the copying process operates: As an investor, you choose which expert or experts you want to
            mirror. After signing up, there’s no further action needed on your part.
            Once you’ve completed this step, you’re all set; there’s no need for complex codes or manual inputs. Our
            software will automatically copy trades on your behalf. We monitor your expert’s trading activity, and when
            a trade is made, we quickly calculate the necessary details and execute the trade.
            The copying mechanism operates based on trade percentages. For instance, if your expert takes a position in
            XYZ coin worth 10% of their account value, and you are fully allocated to that expert, your account will
            also execute a trade for 10% of your account balance.

        <v-col cols="12">
          <p class="text-caption text-sm-body-2">
            Ensure you have enough available base currency that your expert trades with in your account. What does this
            mean? First, you need to meet the exchange's minimum order amount (about $10 per trade, for example).
            Therefore, if your expert executes a 5% order, you need a total account value of at least $300 (assuming
            100% allocation). This means you should also maintain at least 10% or more in available base currency to
            avoid missing any trades.

            When the expert exits a position, you will do the same—automatically. You can also adjust your allocation at
            any time.
